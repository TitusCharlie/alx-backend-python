# 0x02. Python Async Comprehension

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous comprehensions in Python. It involves:
1. Generating random numbers asynchronously using a generator.
2. Collecting those numbers using async comprehensions.
3. Measuring the runtime of asynchronous tasks executed in parallel.

## Files
- **async_generator.py**: Contains a coroutine that generates random numbers asynchronously.
- **async_comprehension.py**: Contains a coroutine that collects random numbers using async comprehensions.
- **measure_runtime.py**: Measures the runtime of multiple async comprehensions running in parallel.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
- Code follows `pycodestyle` guidelines (version 2.5.x).
- All functions and coroutines are type-annotated.
- All modules and functions have proper documentation.
